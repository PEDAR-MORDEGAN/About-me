In 1399 AH, I started learning Python and Scratch Junior.

In late 1399 AH, I became familiar with the Rubika Report and went into this field.

In 1400 AH, I started learning about the areas of influence and reporting on Telegram, Instagram, WhatsApp, and...

From 1401 to 1404 AH, I learned most of the current hacking topics in the world and practiced them extensively.

And right now, I'm building a messaging app for Android and iOS, with the Crimson Wave team, called Kairox.
